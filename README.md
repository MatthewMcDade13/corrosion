# Venvm
Venvm (Venom) Programming Language

Aiming to be a middleground between C and Rust. C backward compat. No headers. Module system. lite functional programming (|> operator and match hopefully). no borrow checker, all code is """unsafe""". memory is up to the programmer. this is headless C with lite ML. LLVM backend.
